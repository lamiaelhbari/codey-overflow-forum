# *CodeyOverflow Forum*

## 🎯 *Project Objective*  
*Web Forum: Comment Section* is a project designed to build the foundation of an `online discussion forum` by creating its most essential `component` — the comment section. Through this application, you will strengthen your *`React`* skills by practicing *`props usage`*, `defining`, `rendering`, and `referencing components`.  

### 🔑 *Key Goals*:  
- *Learn how to structure `nested components in React`.*  
- *Understand data flow in a `component hierarchy` using `props`.*  
- *Enhance your `React` knowledge by `dynamically handling` and `displaying data`.*  

---

## 🔍 *Features*  
- *Reusable Components*: Creation of `parent` (`Card`) and `child` (`Header` and `Body`) components.  
- *Props Utilization*: Data is passed from the `parent` (`App`) to `child components`.  
- *Dynamic Display*: Comments are rendered dynamically based on provided data.  
- *Intuitive Structure*: Logical separation of component responsibilities for organized and readable code.  

---

## 🛠️ *Technologies Used*  
- *`HTML`*: Provides the basic structure of the application.  
- *`CSS`*: Handles styling and layout.  
- *`JavaScript`*: Implements core functionality.  
- *`React`*: JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces.  
- *`JSX`*: Combines HTML structure and JavaScript logic for seamless component rendering.

## 🧠 *Logic and Methods Used*  

### 📝 *Component Structure*  
- *`Body`*: Displays the comment content.  
- *`Header`*: Displays the username and profile image.  
- *`Card`*: Combines `Header` and `Body` `components` for each comment.  
- *`App`*: The top-level component that passes data down to `child components`.  

### 📤 *Data Handling*  
- *`commentData.js`*: A file containing objects representing comments (profile image, username, and comment).  
- *`Props Flow`*: Properties (`profileImg`, `username`, and `comment`) are passed from `App` to `child components` via `Card`.  

### 🖥️ *Dynamic Rendering*  
- *`map()`*: Iterates over the comment data to generate `Card` instances.  
- *`props`*: Distributes data to child components for display.
